ApexMarkets is a fully on-chain, peer-to-peer prediction protocol built on **Arc Network**. By leveraging Arc Network's native USDC gas model, participants can deposit funds, place wagers, and settle transaction fees entirely in USDC — eliminating the traditional onboarding friction associated with maintaining a separate native gas token.

## Key Innovations

### Dynamic Parimutuel Pooling

All wagers on a given event consolidate into a single unified on-chain liquidity pool. Odds adjust continuously in real time based on the distribution of capital across outcomes:

$$\text{Odds}_i = \frac{\text{Total Pool} \times (1 - \text{Fee})}{\text{Outcome Pool}_i}$$

This eliminates the need for direct counterparties and ensures that every participant competes against the aggregate market rather than a house edge.

### Escrowed AI Agent Delegation

Users escrow a USDC budget directly on-chain and authorize an off-chain AI agent to analyze live sports fixtures using FIFA strength ratings. The agent autonomously identifies positive expected-value opportunities and sizes wagers using the **Kelly Criterion** — without ever requiring access to user private keys. Budget revocation is instant and fully user-controlled.

### 100% On-Chain SVG NFT Receipts

Every confirmed wager mints an ERC-721 token containing a fully on-chain SVG receipt generated directly by the smart contract. Bet amount, teams, prediction outcome, and transaction timestamp are Base64-encoded on-chain — ensuring permanent, decentralized visual provenance for every prediction.

---

## How it Works

Participating in ApexMarkets is designed to be seamless. You can make predictions manually or delegate to the AI Betting Agent to place trades automatically.

### Option A: Manual Predictions
1. **Connect Wallet**: Click **Connect Wallet** in the top right to link your Web3 wallet (configured for Arc Network Testnet).
2. **Select a Match**: Browse the **Markets** tab to view list of active sports fixtures or price matchups.
3. **Choose an Outcome**:
   * For Sports: Select **Home**, **Draw**, or **Away**.
   * For Crypto: Select **Yes** (above benchmark price) or **No** (below benchmark price).
4. **Enter Wager**: Input the amount of USDC you wish to bet. The dynamic odds and potential payout will update automatically based on current pool distributions.
5. **Confirm and Claim**: Approve the transaction. You will instantly be minted an **on-chain SVG NFT Receipt** containing your receipt data. Once the match finishes, return to your **Portfolio** to claim your share of the pool if your prediction was correct.

### Option B: Escrowed AI Agent Prediction (Delegated Mode)
1. **Authorize Agent**: Navigate to the **AI Agent** tab and authorize the delegated AI Betting Agent contract to place wagers on your behalf.
2. **Fund Escrow**: Deposit a USDC budget into the prediction market escrow contract. The agent can only bet using this balance.
3. **Set Risk Profile**: Select your risk preference:
   * **Conservative**: Smaller wagers, highly selective EV threshold.
   * **Moderate**: Standard Kelly Criterion fraction sizing.
   * **Aggressive**: Maximum Kelly sizing for higher returns.
4. **Autonomous Execution**: The AI Agent runs 24/7, fetching live FIFA strength ratings and historical stats to find positive expected-value opportunities. It executes bets and logs every transaction in the client console in real time.
5. **Revoke Anytime**: You retain full sovereignty. You can revoke authorization or withdraw your remaining escrow budget instantly at any time.
